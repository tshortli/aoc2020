# Advent of Code 2020

This is where I'll be implementing my solutions to the 2020 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). The [ProjectTemplate](ProjectTemplate/) directory contains the template of the Swift project that I will copy for each solution. It includes a command line executable for driving the solution code, a static library for implementation of the solution, and a unit test bundle for implementing test cases.

Feel free to copy if you find this useful!
